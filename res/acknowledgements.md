> These are basic implementations of standard cryptography algorithms, written by Brad Conte (brad@bradconte.com) from
> scratch and without any cross-licensing. They exist to provide publically accessible, restriction-free implementations
> of popular cryptographic algorithms, like AES and SHA-1. These are primarily intended for educational and pragmatic
> purposes (such as comparing a specification to actual implementation code, or for building an internal application that
> computes test vectors for a product). The algorithms have been tested against standard test vectors.
